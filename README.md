# Conlin Bot

This is a Discord bot for John Conlin's AP Calculus BC class. This hopes to remedy the poor website design by directly connecting anything from his website to Discord.

## Development

Create a file called `.env` in the root and add a Discord token as such:

```
TOKEN=[...]
```

You can now run this with `./gradlew run` (you need to probably have gradle installed for this).
